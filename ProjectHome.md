# Rattlesnake Framework #
**A python scripting framework: _Simple_, _Extensible_, _Out-of-the-box_.**

## Meet Rattlesnake! ##
_**Rattlesnake is a python scripting framework**, born with the following aims:_
  1. **Simple**:
> This framework should simplify the task of scripting, making the user able to create complex scripts in a _simple way_, **minimizing the difficulties**.
  1. **Extensible**:
> No one can imagine what a person wants to do with its own scripts. So the framework gives you the _core_ library, independent from other parts of the framework.
> If someone uses some feature that is not in the framework, he can easily implement it, and, if he wants, share it, **extending the framework**, giving others the possibility to use that feature.
  1. **Out-of-the-box**:
> It is and it always will be _out-of-the-box_, **without any dependeces**. Itâ€™s small and open source, so there aren't any problems with the configuration of the system on which it runs. It's perfect to be included in other projects, because it can perform the scripting part in an easy and secure way.

## Main features ##
  * Jobs scheduling and management using Handlers (an abstraction layer)
  * Parent/children relationships between jobs
  * Job events management by the user
  * Global register for the communication between jobs
  * Exception and errors handlers
  * Input/Output management
  * Some very useful modules to improve scripts
